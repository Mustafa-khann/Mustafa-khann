## 🌟 About Me
Hey there! I'm Mustafa, your friendly neighborhood code wizard.

## 🔧 Technologies & Tools
- **Languages**: C, JavaScript, Python
- **Frameworks**: React, React Native, Node.js, Express.js
- **Tools & Technologies**: Jenkins, AWS, Arduino, LangChain, Agents

## 🔧 Interests
An eclectic mix of curiosity and creativity, always exploring new horizons. Here’s a glimpse into what fascinates me:

- **Low-level C**: Debugging like a digital detective. 🕵️‍♂️
- **Large Language Models**: Teaching machines to converse like humans. 🤖
- **Circuit and PCB Design**: Crafting electronic art where copper traces and components align. 
- **3D Printing**: Spawning objects from nothingness, layer by layer. 
- **IoT**: Making the world smarter, one sensor at a time. (I dream of a home where even the fridge gives motivational speeches.) 🗣️
- **Space Exploration**: Plotting my next interstellar adventure. 🌠
- **Rocket Science**: Understanding how to escape Earth's atmosphere. 🚀
- **Psychology**: Analyzing how people tick and making tech that understands us better. 🧠

## ✨ Fun Facts
- 🌳 Deeply inspired by nature, I solve problems with nature-inspired algorithms. (Yes, I talk to trees sometimes, but they don't mind.)
- 🤖 Built a neural network from scratch, and it was exhilarating! (I may or may not have shouted "It's alive!" at my screen.)
- 🚀 Space is my playground! Dream of rockets and galaxies, with stargazing and plotting interstellar missions on my ideal weekend.
- 🛰️ Drones may have been my first love, but I now enjoy imagining them as space explorers navigating the final frontier.
- 🌌 When not coding, I dive into mathematics, psychology, and aeronautical engineering. (Why not?) I also ponder the universe's secrets and create sci-fi plots with robots and humans teaming up to colonize Mars.
