## 🌟 About Me
Hey there! I'm Mustafa, your friendly neighborhood code wizard. 🧙‍♂️ When I'm not busy turning coffee into code, I'm probably dreaming up ways to blend tech with the wisdom of nature. Think of me as a techie with a touch of zen. 🌿

## 🔧 Technologies & Tools
- **Languages**: C, Java, JavaScript, Golang, Python, HTML, CSS
- **Frameworks**: React, React Native, Node.js, Express.js
- **Tools & Technologies**: Jenkins, AWS, Arduino, LangChain, Agents

## 🔧 Interests
I’m an eclectic mix of curiosity and creativity, always exploring new horizons. Here’s a glimpse into what fascinates me:

- **Low-level C**: Delving into the roots of computing and debugging like a digital detective. 🕵️‍♂️
- **Large Language Models**: Teaching machines to converse like humans and maybe, one day, write poetry with a neural twist. 🤖
- **Circuit and PCB Design**: Crafting electronic art where copper traces and components come together in perfect harmony. 
- **3D Printing**: Spawning objects from nothingness, one layer at a time. It's like digital alchemy! 
- **IoT**: Making the world smarter, one sensor at a time. (I dream of a home where even the fridge gives motivational speeches.) 🗣️
- **Space Exploration**: Plotting my next interstellar adventure. I like to think of myself as a space-faring pioneer with a telescope. 🌠
- **Rocket Science**: Because who doesn’t want to understand how to escape Earth's atmosphere and maybe visit a distant star or two? 🚀
- **Psychology**: Analyzing how people tick and using those insights to make tech that understands us better. (Sometimes I wonder if my code has a personality of its own!) 🧠

## ✨ Fun Facts
- 🌳 I'm deeply inspired by nature and love solving problems with nature-inspired algorithms. (Yes, I talk to trees sometimes, but they don't mind.)
- 🤖 I recently built a neural network from scratch, and it was exhilarating! (I may or may not have shouted "It's alive!" at my screen.)
- 🚀 Space is my playground! I dream of rockets and galaxies and have a soft spot for the mysteries of the cosmos. (My ideal weekend involves stargazing and plotting interstellar missions.)
- 🛰️ Drones may have been my first love, but I’ve moved on to grander things. Still, I enjoy imagining drones as space explorers navigating the final frontier. (They probably wouldn’t complain about zero gravity!)
- 🌌 When I'm not coding, I enjoy studying mathematics, psychology, and aeronautical engineering. (Because why not?) I also ponder the secrets of the universe and occasionally create sci-fi plots where robots and humans team up to colonize Mars.
